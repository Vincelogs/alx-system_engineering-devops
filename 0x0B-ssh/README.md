Along with this project, you have been attributed an Ubuntu server, living in a datacenter far far away. Like level 2 of the application process, you will connect using `ssh`. But contrary to level 2, you will not connect using a password but an RSA key. Weâ€™ve configured your server with the public key you created in the first task of a [previous project(Go back to project "0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing")](https://intranet.alxswe.com/tasks/1223) shared in your [intranet profile](https://intranet.alxswe.com/users/my_profile).

You can access your server information in the [my servers](https://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/244) section of the intranet, each line with contains the IP and username you should use to connect via `ssh`.

Note: Your server is configured with an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment.

### Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- What is a server
- Where servers usually live
- What is SSH
- How to create an SSH RSA key pair
- How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
- The advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`
